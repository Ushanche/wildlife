        Wilpattu's unique topography, characterized by dense scrublands, serene natural lakes, and open grassy plains,
        creates an ideal habitat for these elusive creatures. Exhibiting solitary and territorial behavior, leopards in
        Wilpattu are primarily nocturnal, displaying heightened activity during the cooler hours of the day and night.
        The park's rich ecosystem sustains a variety of prey species, ranging from spotted and sambar deer to wild boar,
        allowing leopards to showcase their prowess as apex predators. Conservation efforts are imperative to mitigate
        threats such as habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, ensuring the continued survival of the Sri Lankan
        leopard in this remarkable natural haven. For wildlife enthusiasts, Wilpattu National Park offers an

      <h3>Habitat Loss</h3>
      <center><img src="./images/habiata.jpg"></center>
      <p>Habitat loss poses a grave threat to the survival of leopards in Sri Lanka, particularly the indigenous Sri
        Lankan leopard species. The escalating deforestation driven by agricultural expansion, urbanization, and
        infrastructure development is systematically eroding the natural habitats crucial for the leopards' existence.
        Human settlements encroaching upon traditional leopard territories intensify conflicts between people and
        wildlife, often resulting in retaliatory measures against the leopards. Plantation agriculture, marked by vast
        tea and rubber plantations, further fragments and diminishes leopard habitats, affecting both prey availability
        and the overall biodiversity essential for a thriving leopard population. Infrastructure projects, illegal
        logging, and land encroachments exacerbate the problem, disrupting wildlife corridors and isolating leopard
        subpopulations. Even within protected areas, human activities like illegal logging and settlements can degrade
        the quality of leopard habitats. Addressing this complex issue necessitates a multi-faceted approach, involving
        the establishment and effective management of protected areas, habitat restoration initiatives, and
        community-based conservation efforts. Striking a balance between human development and wildlife conservation is
        imperative to secure the continued existence of leopards in Sri Lanka, emphasizing the importance of sustainable
        practices and fostering public awareness about the significance of preserving both natural environments and
        their inhabitants.</p><br>

      <h2>Poaching Of Leopards</h2>
      <center><img src="./images/poaching.jpg"></center>
      <p>The poaching of leopards in Sri Lanka presents a severe threat to the already vulnerable population of these
        majestic felines. Poaching is primarily driven by the illegal wildlife trade, where leopard skins, bones, and
        other body parts are sought after for their perceived medicinal or ornamental value. The demand for leopard
        parts, both within the country and internationally, has led to an alarming increase in illegal hunting
        activities. Poachers often use snares and other cruel methods to trap leopards, contributing to injuries and
        fatalities. Moreover, habitat loss exacerbates the problem, pushing leopards into closer proximity with human
        settlements and increasing the likelihood of conflicts that can result in retaliatory killings. The lack of
        stringent law enforcement, coupled with the high demand for leopard products, poses a significant challenge to
        conservation efforts. Efforts to combat leopard poaching in Sri Lanka require a combination of strict law
        enforcement, international cooperation to curb illegal wildlife trade, and community engagement to raise
        awareness and promote the coexistence of humans and leopards. Conservation initiatives must address both the
        supply and demand sides of the issue to ensure the long-term survival of these iconic predators in the region.
