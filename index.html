      <p>Sri Lanka is renowned for its exceptional biodiversity, with a wide array of ecosystems and a high percentage
        of endemic species. The country's diverse ecological zones, ranging from the "wet zone" to the "dry zone,"
        contribute to its rich wildlife population. Sri Lanka is home to a remarkable variety of flora and fauna,
        including 4000 species of flowering plants, 107 species of freshwater fish, 59 species of amphibians, 174
        species of reptiles, 435 species of birds, 140 species of mammals, and several thousand invertebrates. The
        country's unique biological diversity is facing various threats, including habitat loss, pollution, invasive
        species, overexploitation, and climate change. Despite these challenges, Sri Lanka remains a paradise for
        wildlife enthusiasts, offering opportunities to experience diverse wildlife in its numerous national parks and
        reserves.



        The wildlife of Sri Lanka is a testament to the country's rich biodiversity, with a high concentration of
        endemic species and a wide range of ecosystems. From the lush rainforests to the diverse coastal marine life,
        Sri Lanka's natural heritage is a treasure trove for nature lovers. The country's efforts to conserve its
        wildlife in the face of various threats reflect a commitment to preserving this unique and irreplaceable natural
        heritage.

      <section id="rain">
        <p>Sri Lanka is home to a variety of ecosystems, and while it doesn't have the extensive rainforests that some
          other tropical regions boast, it does have areas of lush, diverse vegetation that can be considered
          rainforest-like. The Sinharaja Forest Reserve, located in the southwest of the country, is one such area and
          is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

          Sinharaja is the last viable area of primary tropical rainforest in Sri Lanka, and it harbors a rich
          biodiversity with numerous endemic species. The forest is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including
          unique bird species like the Sri Lanka blue magpie and the red-faced malkoha. Additionally, various mammals,
          amphibians, reptiles, and insects contribute to the area's ecological significance.

          Conservation efforts are in place to preserve the Sinharaja Rainforest and its biodiversity, recognizing its
          importance in maintaining the ecological balance and safeguarding endemic species. Visitors to Sinharaja
          have the opportunity to explore its trails and appreciate the beauty and ecological significance of this
          unique rainforest environment.</p>

      <section id="Dry">

        <p>Dry forests in Sri Lanka, primarily located in the northern and northwestern regions, constitute a
          distinctive ecological niche within the country's diverse landscape. Characterized by prolonged dry periods
          during the seasonal cycles, these forests showcase a remarkable array of flora and fauna adapted to thrive
          in semi-arid conditions. Drought-resistant tree species, thorny shrubs, and deciduous vegetation dominate
          the landscape, strategically shedding leaves to conserve water during arid spells. Despite the challenging
          environment, dry forests harbor a rich biodiversity, featuring unique bird species, mammals, reptiles, and
          insects that have evolved to endure and flourish in these conditions. Human communities often intersect with
          these ecosystems, relying on them for resources such as firewood and traditional medicinal plants. Balancing
          the needs of local populations with conservation efforts is crucial, as dry forests face threats from
          deforestation, habitat degradation, and the impacts of climate change. Conservation initiatives, including
          sustainable management practices and community involvement, are essential to ensure the preservation of
          these ecosystems. Moreover, recognizing the potential for eco-tourism in certain areas provides an avenue
          for appreciating the unique attributes of Sri Lanka's dry forests while supporting their conservation.</p>

      <section id="montaneforest">
        <p>Montane forests in Sri Lanka, nestled within the central highlands at elevations exceeding 1,000 meters,
          stand as remarkable ecosystems shaped by unique climatic conditions. Characterized by cooler temperatures
          and increased precipitation compared to lowlands, these forests, found in areas like the Knuckles Mountain
          Range and Horton Plains, exhibit a distinct flora and fauna. The stunted and gnarled trees, along with a
          diverse array of mosses, ferns, and endemic flowering plants, contribute to the intricate tapestry of
          montane vegetation. Endowed with biodiversity hotspots, these forests house endemic bird species, mammals,
          and insects that have evolved in isolation at higher altitudes. Beyond their ecological richness, montane
          forests play a vital role in water regulation, serving as crucial water catchment areas for rivers and
          streams originating in these elevated regions. Conservation efforts are paramount, given the threats posed
          by human activities such as agriculture and logging, emphasizing the need to safeguard these delicate
          ecosystems. Accessible to tourists and researchers, these montane forest areas offer opportunities for
          exploration and study, promoting both awareness and support for the preservation of their unique and fragile
          ecology. In essence, the montane forests of Sri Lanka stand as testament to the island's biodiversity and
          underscore the importance of conservation in maintaining the ecological balance of these high-altitude
          environments.</p>
