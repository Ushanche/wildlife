        <h3>Sinharaja Forest</h3>
        <img src="./images/sinha.webp">

        <section id="sinha">
          <p>Nestled in the verdant hills of Sri Lanka's southern region, Sinharaja Forest Reserve encompasses the last
            extensive tract of unbroken, primary tropical rainforest in the country. Gazetted as a UNESCO World Heritage
            Site and Biosphere Reserve, this unique ecosystem shelters staggering biodiversity within its dense tangle
            of vegetation. The towering trees, festooned in vines and epiphytes, echo with birdsong as endemic species
            like Sri Lanka blue magpies flit through the canopy alongside more widespread jungle fowl and drongos. Rare
            serpent eagles may also sight their slippery prey from lofty perches. Sinharaja’s elephants tread ancient
            paths long familiar under their sturdy feet, while leopards haunt the shadowy brush and elusive
            rusty-spotted cats stalk past humming cicadas. The reserve protects over 50% of the country’s endemic
            species of mammals, butterflies, insects, fish, and plants. Its 212 woody plant species per hectare far
            exceeds comparable rainforest diversity. Botanists continue identifying new endemic plants within its
            shadowed recesses, like the recent discovery of a striking new ginger species. From sparkling mountain
            rivulets winding through gnarled kitul palm groves, to thick tendrils of purple welpendela draping the stout
            boles of satinwood trees, Sinharaja's ecosystems teem with indigenous character from ridge to valley.
            However, this ecological profusion remains vulnerable to encroaching settlement, illegal logging, pollution,
            and the greater threat of climate shifts. Careful management combining preservation, research,
            reforestation, and environmental education offers hope for Sinharaja’s future as home for its wild denizens
            great and small.</p>

        <h3>Kumana National Park</h3>
        <img src="./images/kuma.jpg">
        <section id="kumana">
          <p>Kumana National Park, situated in the southeastern corner of Sri Lanka, unfolds as a sprawling natural
            treasure spanning approximately 35,664 hectares. This diverse landscape encompasses dry grasslands, mangrove
            swamps, and scenic lagoons, creating a haven for a rich tapestry of flora and fauna. Established initially
            as a bird sanctuary in 1938, it earned national park status in 2006, contributing significantly to the
            ecological diversity of the Yala-Kumana complex.

            The park's foremost allure lies in its recognition as a globally significant bird sanctuary. Boasting over
            200 bird species, including captivating migratory birds like the elegant Greater Flamingo, Eurasian
            Spoonbill, and Black-capped Kingfisher, Kumana is a paradise for avid birdwatchers. The peak season for bird
            migration from April to July transforms the park into a vibrant aviary, offering visitors an unparalleled
            spectacle of avian diversity.

            While renowned for its avian inhabitants, Kumana is also a habitat for various terrestrial species. Leopards
            and elephants roam freely, adding an element of excitement to wildlife encounters. The park's waterholes and
            lagoons, set against picturesque landscapes, create ideal settings for observing wildlife and capturing
            breathtaking photographs.

            The mangrove ecosystems along Kumana's eastern boundary are of particular ecological importance, serving as
            a breeding ground for marine life and contributing to the overall environmental balance. The park's diverse
            flora, including dry grasslands, scrublands, and patches of dense forest, provides habitat and sustenance
            for its varied wildlife.

            Conservation efforts are integral to Kumana National Park, as it remains a protected area dedicated to
            preserving its unique biodiversity. Eco-friendly and responsible tourism practices are encouraged, with
            guided safaris providing visitors an opportunity to explore the park while minimizing their impact on the
            environment.

            In essence, Kumana National Park beckons nature enthusiasts and wildlife lovers with its captivating blend
            of avian wonders, scenic landscapes, and a commitment to conservation. Whether embarking on a birdwatching
            adventure or encountering terrestrial wildlife, Kumana offers a holistic and enriching experience for those
            seeking the beauty of Sri Lanka's natural heritage.</p>

            Recognizable by its broad snout and rough appearance, the mugger crocodile is adept at tolerating brackish
            water. In Kumana, these crocodiles primarily prey on fish and small mammals, contributing to the park's
